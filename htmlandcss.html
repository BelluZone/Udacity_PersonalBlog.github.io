                <h2>Learning HTML and CSS with Udacity</h2>
                <p class="text">Learning web development had always been a goal of mine, but I didn’t know where to start. The world
                    of coding seemed vast and complex, and I felt overwhelmed by the endless resources available online.
                    Then, I stumbled upon Udacity and their HTML and CSS course, and everything changed. Here's my
                    experience of learning HTML and CSS through Udacity, and why it turned out to be a game-changer for
                    me.</p>

                    <h3>Why I Choose Udacity</h3>
                    <p class="text">As someone who wasn’t initially into coding, I needed a structured learning path. While there are
                        plenty of free tutorials and courses available, Udacity stood out due to its comprehensive
                        curriculum and well-organized approach. I had already created my own learning path, but
                        Udacity's course aligned perfectly with it. The platform provided a mix of theoretical lessons
                        and practical exercises that made even complex concepts easy to grasp. The hands-on nature of
                        the course encouraged me to apply my knowledge immediately, which was essential for retaining
                        the information.</p>

                    <h3>The Learning Experience</h3>
                    <p class="text">From the very first lesson, Udacity’s HTML and CSS course impressed me with its clear,
                        beginner-friendly explanations. The course began by introducing the basic structure of a
                        webpage: the essential HTML tags and the importance of using semantic elements. I quickly
                        learned that HTML serves as the backbone of any webpage, organizing and structuring content.

                        The real magic, however, began when I started learning CSS. CSS controls the look and feel of a
                        website, and learning it opened up a world of creativity. I was introduced to key concepts like
                        colors, fonts, layouts, and responsive design using grid and flexbox. Slowly, I learned how to
                        transform a simple webpage from functional to visually appealing.</p>

                    <h3>Key Takeaways from the Course</h3>
                    <ol class="text">
                        <li>Fundamentals of HTML</li>
                        <p>Learning HTML was like understanding the building blocks of a house. I learned how to create
                            headings, paragraphs, links, images, and forms—essentials for any website. The course also
                            emphasized how to structure a webpage efficiently, which helped me understand the importance
                            of clean, organized code.</p>
                        <li>Diving into CSS</li>
                        <p>CSS is what truly brought my pages to life. With Udacity’s course, I learned about selectors,
                            the box model, positioning, flexbox, and responsive design. The flexbox layout, in
                            particular, was a game-changer for me, allowing me to create flexible and responsive
                            designs. CSS also taught me how to make websites mobile-friendly, an essential skill in
                            today’s world, where users access sites across a variety of devices.</p>
                        <li>Learning by Doing</li>
                        <p>What truly set Udacity apart for me was the "learning by doing" approach. Every concept was
                            followed by practical coding exercises that helped reinforce what I had learned. This
                            hands-on experience helped me build confidence in my abilities, as I could see my progress
                            and improvements in real-time.</p>

                    <h3>Challanges Faced</h3>
                    <p class="text">No learning journey is without its challenges, and mine was no exception. At times, I found the
                        explanations of the basics to be a bit too simple. It felt like the more complex best practices
                        were reserved for later lessons. However, there was a small project within the program where I
                        felt I could have benefited from a deeper understanding before diving into it. Despite this, I
                        pushed through, and it ended up being a valuable learning experience.</p>

                    <h3>Moving Forward</h3>
                    <p class="text">After completing the HTML and CSS basics course, I feel confident in my ability to build simple
                        websites. But I’m not stopping here. My next step is learning JavaScript to add interactivity to
                        my pages and expand my web development skill set.</p>
